# FBLA Engage

FBLA Engage is an iOS mobile application designed to improve FBLA member engagement by centralizing communication, events, resources, and chapter connections in one secure and accessible platform.

This project was developed for the FBLA Mobile Application Development competitive event (2025–2026).
